# A simple instagram-type backend service

A simple JavaScript content management backend application in [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) standard for image-conent management (uploading images, applying tags and filters, removing them and more). It was a school asignment for ServerSide-Applications Classes. The version on GitHub is the latest one (before it was patched localy and this is also the first version that was actually uploaded to github by me). The project was abandoned due to lack of time during a school-year (2022). However it is ready to be developed further. 

## Usage

All the sample test files are located in `/test` directory. There are three individual `x-...-.http` files. Each one covers a different area for the project. It is important to mention that you need a file to operate on while testing the other two controllers.
```
`/test/x-files.http` covers the entire file-management system. 
`/test/x-filters.http` covers the filter system for uploaded image files.  
`/test/x-tags.http` covers the tag system for uploaded image files. 
```

### x-files.http
`/test/x-files.http` covers the entire file-management system. 

<br>**Upload an image**
```js
POST http://localhost:3000/api/photos HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----FormBoundary1234

------FormBoundary1234
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="test-image.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

< ./test-image.jpg

------FormBoundary1234
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="album"
Content-Type: text/plain

nazwa_albumu
------FormBoundary1234
```

<br>**See the image and its metadata.** You need to provide the image ID as a parameter.
```js
// GET http://localhost:3000/api/photos/image_id HTTP/1.1

example:
GET http://localhost:3000/api/photos/1661768334201 HTTP/1.1
```

<br>**See the entire album and read metadata for each image**
```js
GET http://localhost:3000/api/photos HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

<br>**Patch the image**
```js
PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/photos/1661768334201 HTTP/1.1
```

<br>**Delete the image**
```js
DELETE  http://localhost:3000/api/photos/1661768334201 HTTP/1.1
```

### x-filters.http
`/test/x-files.http` covers the entire file-management system.

### x-tags.http
`/test/x-files.http` covers the entire file-management system.
